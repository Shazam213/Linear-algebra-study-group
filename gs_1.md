  * Column picture:

  * Linear combination of columns (AX=b) here b can be anything for the set of equations as the two vectors can fill up the entire plane
* Eg2.
  * Equations:

  * Row picture hard to visualize
  * Column picture:
  * ![i5](assets/Screenshot%20from%202022-11-13%2001-06-05.png)
  * If all the vectors lie in same plane then the solution will also lie in that plane and we would not get b for all vectors in the entire 3D space
  * Matrix multiplication Ax=b
